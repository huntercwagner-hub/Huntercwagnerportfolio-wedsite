  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is <b>Hunter Wagner</b>, and I am a Mechanical Engineering student at the <b>University of West Florida</b> with a focus on design, testing, and mechatronic systems. Iâ€™m passionate about transforming ideas into working systems through a balance of creativity, analysis, and practical problem-solving.</p>

  <p>Throughout my coursework and projects, Iâ€™ve developed strong experience in mechanical design, automation, materials testing, and systems integration. From managing team-based aerospace design challenges like <b>AIAA Design Build Fly</b> to building <b>automated turret and sensor-based robotics systems</b> in mechatronics, Iâ€™ve enjoyed applying classroom theory to hands-on engineering work.</p>

  <p>I take pride in both technical precision and teamwork â€” collaborating effectively across disciplines to meet performance goals and deadlines. My approach blends design optimization, analytical modeling, and iteration to develop systems that are functional, efficient, and manufacturable.</p>

  <p>Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing opportunities that will let me apply my background in <b>mechanical systems, aerospace design, hvac, manufactoring, and automation</b> to real-world engineering projects, while continuing to grow as a technical leader and problem solver.</p>
