    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p><b>Objective:</b> The goal of this project was to design, build, and test a fully functional trebuchet capable of launching a projectile over <b>250 yards</b>. The challenge combined physics, structural mechanics, and practical engineering to create a precise and repeatable machine for long-range projectile motion.</p>
    <p>Our team was tasked with developing a comprehensive design that incorporated <b>analytical calculations</b>, <b>CAD modeling</b>, and <b>finite element analysis (FEA)</b> to verify structural safety and performance. The entire build‚Äîfrom initial concept to successful test launches‚Äîwas completed within a one-month time frame.</p>

    <h2>Design and Development</h2>
    <p>As a member of the <b>structure team</b>, my role focused on the design, mathematical modeling, and CAD development of the trebuchet‚Äôs framework and throwing arm. I performed all structural load and stress calculations to ensure the frame and pivot assembly could safely support the counterweight and launch forces.</p>
    <p>The design was developed using <b>SolidWorks</b> to create both detailed and assembly-level models. Every component‚Äîfrom the throwing arm to the base supports‚Äîwas dimensioned for manufacturability using standard wood sections. Structural integrity and performance were validated using <b>ANSYS</b> for static and dynamic loading scenarios.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Software Tools:</b> SolidWorks (3D modeling), ANSYS (FEA analysis), Excel (data processing and equations)</li>
      <li><b>Design Focus:</b> Arm stiffness, pivot reaction forces, load path optimization, and stability under counterweight release</li>
      <li><b>Construction:</b> Wood and steel hybrid frame with adjustable counterweight attachment</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Simulation and Ballistic Analysis</h2>
    <p>Using analytical methods, I modeled the trebuchet‚Äôs throwing motion to estimate launch velocity and projectile trajectory. These calculations formed the basis of a <b>ballistic firing chart</b>, predicting projectile range across various release angles and counterweight ratios.</p>
    <p>The structure was validated through <b>FEA simulations</b> in ANSYS, ensuring the arm, axle supports, and base experienced stresses well below material limits. The Excel-based solver used during design was included within the final report to show parameter sensitivity for key variables such as arm ratio, sling length, and projectile mass.</p>

    <h2>Testing and Results</h2>
    <p>The completed trebuchet was tested under multiple loading conditions to measure range, accuracy, and structural behavior. Initial launches achieved distances approaching the <b>250-yard target</b>, with minimal frame deflection and stable projectile release. The analytical predictions closely matched observed results, validating both the design and simulation models.</p>
    <p>Throughout the project, rapid iteration and teamwork were key. The ability to integrate theoretical analysis, CAD design, and real-world testing allowed the team to meet tight deadlines and produce a reliable, high-performing mechanical system.</p>
