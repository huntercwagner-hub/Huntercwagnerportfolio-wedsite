    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p><b>Objective:</b> Design, fabricate, and test an RC aircraft capable of completing the SAE Aero Design competition missions. The team‚Äôs goal was to create a lightweight, wood-based airframe with optimized lift-to-weight efficiency while ensuring structural stability through finite element analysis and aerodynamic simulation.</p>
    <p>As part of the University of West Florida‚Äôs SAE Aero Design team, I contributed to the design, analysis, and manufacturing of our competition aircraft. The project emphasized aerodynamic accuracy, strength-to-weight optimization, and manufacturability using laser-cut balsa and plywood components.</p>

    <h2>Design and Engineering Process</h2>
    <p>The aircraft was fully modeled in <b>SolidWorks</b>, with each part designed to be laser-cut from wood sheets for fast and consistent assembly. I developed both a detailed 3D CAD model and a 2D flattened version used for the laser cutting process.</p>
    <p>I performed <b>Finite Element Analysis (FEA)</b> using ANSYS on the fuselage and wing baffle structures to validate stress levels during maximum load conditions. The baffle, critical for load transfer between the wings and fuselage, was designed and optimized to minimize deflection while maintaining a lightweight structure.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Software Tools:</b> SolidWorks, ANSYS, XFLR5</li>
      <li><b>Materials:</b> Balsa wood, birch plywood, carbon fiber spars</li>
      <li><b>Manufacturing:</b> Laser cutting, epoxy assembly, weight balancing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Aerodynamic & Structural Analysis</h2>
    <p>Using <b>XFLR5</b>, I analyzed the aerodynamic forces on the aircraft, calculating lift distribution and required wing loading across multiple flight speeds. This data was used to size the wing spars and baffle system before running structural FEA in ANSYS.</p>
    <p>The analysis verified that the aircraft‚Äôs wooden structure could safely withstand flight loads and landing stresses. Results confirmed sufficient stiffness, with deflection remaining below the target 2% of span under full lift conditions.</p>
