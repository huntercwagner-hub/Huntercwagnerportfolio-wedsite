    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p><b>Objective:</b> Design and construct an <b>automated turret system</b> capable of detecting, tracking, and targeting an object autonomously using servo actuation and sensor input. The turret was programmed and built from the ground up using an <b>Arduino microcontroller</b>, custom mechanical components, and embedded control logic.</p>
    <p>This project was completed as a <b>solo effort</b> for my Mechatronics course. I was responsible for every stage of development ‚Äî including circuit design, hardware fabrication, embedded coding, testing, and iteration. Over the span of three full design cycles, I redesigned both the mechanical and software systems until achieving consistent and accurate operation.</p>

    <h2>Design and Development</h2>
    <p>The first step involved designing the mechanical structure for the turret base and gimbal system. Using <b>SolidWorks</b>, I created a fully parameterized model allowing for easy adjustment of servo positions and axis alignments. The frame and mounting system were fabricated by hand using aluminum brackets, laser-cut acrylic, and 3D printed supports.</p>
    <p>The control system was centered around an <b>Arduino Uno</b> microcontroller. The turret was programmed in C++ using the Arduino IDE to process input data from ultrasonic and IR sensors, calculate angle offsets, and command servo positioning for both pitch and yaw control.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Software Tools:</b> Arduino IDE (C++), SolidWorks (mechanical design), MATLAB (data testing)</li>
      <li><b>Hardware Components:</b> Arduino Uno, SG90 servos, ultrasonic sensors, IR sensor array</li>
      <li><b>Design Iterations:</b> 3 total ‚Äî each improving stability, response speed, and mechanical durability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Control Logic and Programming</h2>
    <p>The turret operates based on sensor feedback loops that continuously update servo positions to maintain a target lock. My code implements <b>angle filtering</b> and <b>PID-style control</b> for smoother servo response and reduced oscillation. I wrote all embedded code manually, ensuring full understanding of timing constraints and sensor-to-actuator coordination.</p>
    <p>During testing, I incorporated diagnostic serial output to monitor response delay, detection accuracy, and servo angle changes in real time. Each iteration of code reduced reaction lag and improved target stability, especially under variable lighting conditions or moving targets.</p>

    <h2>Testing and Results</h2>
    <p>After three design revisions, the turret achieved smooth and stable operation, successfully tracking targets within its sensor range. The final system demonstrated real-time detection, movement prediction, and accurate servo tracking. Testing validated that the control logic was robust under varying environmental conditions.</p>
    <p>This project demonstrated a complete integration of <b>mechanical design</b>, <b>electronic control systems</b>, and <b>software development</b> ‚Äî core skills of a modern mechatronics engineer. It also reinforced the importance of iterative prototyping and debugging in electromechanical design.</p>
